# WeeklyEmployeeScheduleManager
This web-based application uses PHP/MySQL to manage employees, employee availability, shifts, and schedules. Normal employees can log in, update user info/password, and see work schedules for the current and upcoming weeks. Managers can see all employees, add/remove users, create schedules, add/update events that require staff, and remove previous events/shifts.
